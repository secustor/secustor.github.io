This talk has been presented at [OSS 2024 Europe](https://www.oss2024.eu/) and evolves around how to extract dependency data with Renovate.
It includes three ways to get the data:

- Dependency Dashboards
- Logs
- and the new Report feature

Further it contains a demo of the [Renovate Backstage plugin](https://github.com/secustor/backstage-plugins/) as well as helpful configuration to set up your Renovate instance up for extraction purposes.
