Hi, I'm **Sebastian Poxhofer** – Tech Lead for **Developer Experience & Platform Engineering** at N26. I design, scale, and evolve internal platforms that let product teams ship faster and safer across **multi-cluster Kubernetes** and **hybrid (cloud + datacenter) environments** in regulated contexts (finance, government, insurance, healthcare).

Over the past decade I've moved from the experimental chaos of homelabbing into building resilient, compliant, and developer-friendly platforms at scale. My work blends: Kubernetes architecture, IDP enablement (Backstage), supply chain & dependency governance (Renovate), observability (OpenTelemetry), and SRE/operational excellence practices.

---

### My Value Proposition

I help organizations transform ad‑hoc infrastructure into a **productized internal platform** with clear interfaces, paved paths, and measurable developer outcomes. The result: shorter lead times, lower cognitive load, higher reliability, and sustainable security & compliance.

---

### Core Focus Areas

- **Platform & DevEx Strategy:** Vision, north-star architecture, maturity assessment, org & ownership model, product mindset adoption.
- **Kubernetes Platform Architecture:** Multi-cluster / multi-region design, GitOps (Argo CD / Flux), cluster lifecycle (Cluster API), upgrade & drift management, cost & capacity optimization.
- **Hybrid Cloud & Datacenter Integration:** Secure connectivity, service discovery, workload placement strategy, gradual migration & coexistence patterns.
- **Golden Paths & Internal Developer Portal (Backstage):** Software & infra templates, scorecards, tech docs, plugin design (including custom dependency intelligence via Renovate data).
- **Supply Chain Security & Dependency Management:** Renovate program design, policy-as-code, SBOM integration, vulnerability triage workflows, automation guardrails.
- **Observability & Operational Insight:** OpenTelemetry-first telemetry pipelines, metrics/traces/log unification, SLO frameworks, actionable dashboards vs vanity graphs.
- **Governance & Compliance Enablement:** Policy enforcement (OPA/Gatekeeper/Kyverno), auditability, guardrails vs gates, separation of concerns, secure defaults.
- **Reliability & SRE Practices:** SLO definition, error budgets, incident review loops, capacity planning, resilience testing.
- **Developer Productivity Analytics:** Lead time, MTTR, onboarding time, dependency freshness, reliability indicators – turning metrics into platform backlog signals.

---

### Selected Impact Themes

- Reduced dependency patch cycle time & minimized critical vulnerability exposure windows through Renovate automation programs.
- Accelerated service onboarding via curated templates & golden paths (infra + CI + telemetry baked in) surfaced through Backstage.
- Lowered operational toil with GitOps-driven fleet management and standardized cluster baselines.
- Improved release confidence & mean time to recovery through robust telemetry, SLO governance, and actionable runbooks.
- De-risked regulated workloads by embedding compliance controls into platform layers instead of manual approval gates.

### Signals I Can Help You If…

- Lead times are increasing and teams reinvent infra patterns repeatedly.
- Kubernetes footprint grew organically; upgrades, policies, and cost feel fragile or ad‑hoc.
- Backstage (or another IDP) adoption is stalling beyond initial enthusiasm.
- Vulnerability backlog & dependency drift are outpacing remediation capacity.
- Observability data exists but reliability decisions feel guessy.
- Hybrid/on-prem + cloud integration is slowing modernization efforts.
