description: "Platform Engineering & Kubernetes Consulting – Tech Lead DevEx (N26). Hybrid cloud & on‑prem enablement, IDP, GitOps, supply chain security, observability, SLOs."
---

Hi, I'm **Sebastian Poxhofer** – Tech Lead for **Developer Experience & Platform Engineering** at N26. I design, scale, and evolve internal platforms that let product teams ship faster and safer across **multi-cluster Kubernetes** and **hybrid (cloud + datacenter) environments** in regulated contexts (finance, government, insurance, healthcare).

Over the past decade I've moved from the experimental chaos of homelabbing into building resilient, compliant, and developer-friendly platforms at scale. My work blends: Kubernetes architecture, IDP enablement (Backstage), supply chain & dependency governance (Renovate), observability (OpenTelemetry), and SRE/operational excellence practices.

---
### My Value Proposition
I help organizations transform ad‑hoc infrastructure into a **productized internal platform** with clear interfaces, paved paths, and measurable developer outcomes. The result: shorter lead times, lower cognitive load, higher reliability, and sustainable security & compliance.

---
### Core Focus Areas
- **Platform & DevEx Strategy:** Vision, north-star architecture, maturity assessment, org & ownership model, product mindset adoption.
- **Kubernetes Platform Architecture:** Multi-cluster / multi-region design, GitOps (Argo CD / Flux), cluster lifecycle (Cluster API), upgrade & drift management, cost & capacity optimization.
- **Hybrid Cloud & Datacenter Integration:** Secure connectivity, service discovery, workload placement strategy, gradual migration & coexistence patterns.
- **Golden Paths & Internal Developer Portal (Backstage):** Software & infra templates, scorecards, tech docs, plugin design (including custom dependency intelligence via Renovate data).
- **Supply Chain Security & Dependency Management:** Renovate program design, policy-as-code, SBOM integration, vulnerability triage workflows, automation guardrails.
- **Observability & Operational Insight:** OpenTelemetry-first telemetry pipelines, metrics/traces/log unification, SLO frameworks, actionable dashboards vs vanity graphs.
- **Governance & Compliance Enablement:** Policy enforcement (OPA/Gatekeeper/Kyverno), auditability, guardrails vs gates, separation of concerns, secure defaults.
- **Reliability & SRE Practices:** SLO definition, error budgets, incident review loops, capacity planning, resilience testing.
- **Developer Productivity Analytics:** Lead time, MTTR, onboarding time, dependency freshness, reliability indicators – turning metrics into platform backlog signals.

---
### Selected Impact Themes
- Reduced dependency patch cycle time & minimized critical vulnerability exposure windows through Renovate automation programs.
- Accelerated service onboarding via curated templates & golden paths (infra + CI + telemetry baked in) surfaced through Backstage.
- Lowered operational toil with GitOps-driven fleet management and standardized cluster baselines.
- Improved release confidence & mean time to recovery through robust telemetry, SLO governance, and actionable runbooks.
- De-risked regulated workloads by embedding compliance controls into platform layers instead of manual approval gates.

|----------|----------|
| Platform Vision & Roadmap | Actionable maturity model, phased adoption plan, stakeholder alignment |
| Kubernetes Architecture | High-availability & scalable multi-cluster design, lifecycle & upgrade playbooks |
| Golden Paths (Backstage) | Templates, software catalog curation, scorecards, plugin extensions |
| GitOps Enablement | Repo structure, environment promotion strategy, drift detection, RBAC model |
| Supply Chain & Dependencies | Renovate policy architecture, vulnerability triage workflow, freshness reporting |
| Observability & Telemetry | OTel pipelines, SLOs, dashboards, alert strategy (noise reduction) |
| Governance & Policy | Guardrail policies, compliance evidence automation, audit trail design |
| Reliability & Operations | Incident review framework, resilience testing patterns, capacity models |

---
### Engagement Models
- **Assessment & Strategy Sprint (2–4 weeks):** Maturity baseline, gap analysis, prioritized roadmap.
- **Implementation Partnership:** Hands-on enablement delivering architectural foundations, automation, and golden paths.
- **Targeted Deep Dives:** Focus on a single pillar (e.g., GitOps, Backstage adoption, supply chain security, OTel rollout).
- **Custom Development:** Backstage plugins, Renovate data integrations, platform tooling extensions.
- **Workshops & Training:** Kubernetes platform operations, SLO design, policy-as-code, IDP product mindset.
- **Ongoing Advisory:** Fractional platform/DevEx leadership, roadmap refinement, metrics instrumentation.

---
### Why Work With Me?
- **Tech Lead DevEx (N26):** Real-world experience scaling a platform in a fast-moving, regulated fintech context.
- **Renovate Maintainer:** Deep knowledge of dependency automation & supply chain security levers.
- **OpenTelemetry Contributor:** Up-to-date on emerging observability standards & implementation pitfalls.
- **Backstage Community Member & Contributor:** Experience crafting plugins & integrating dependency intelligence into IDP workflows.
- **Hybrid & Regulated Experience:** Delivered platforms spanning German health insurance, government, banking – embedding compliance without crushing velocity.
- **Product Mindset:** Treating the platform as a product with discovery, feedback loops, measurable outcomes.
- **Open Source Ethos:** Preference for transparent, extensible solutions over opaque vendor lock-in.

---
### Signals I Can Help You If…
- Lead times are increasing and teams reinvent infra patterns repeatedly.
- Kubernetes footprint grew organically; upgrades, policies, and cost feel fragile or ad‑hoc.
- Backstage (or another IDP) adoption is stalling beyond initial enthusiasm.
- Vulnerability backlog & dependency drift are outpacing remediation capacity.
- Observability data exists but reliability decisions feel guessy.
- Hybrid/on-prem + cloud integration is slowing modernization efforts.
