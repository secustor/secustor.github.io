## What is Renovate?
Renovate is a powerful open-source tool that automates dependency management. 
It can automatically update your dependencies, create pull requests for normal source code dependencies as well as for custom references like usual in enterprise environments.   
This includes internal source code dependencies, Docker images, and even GitHub Actions workflows.

## What is Claude Code?
[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/) is an AI-powered code assistant developed by [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/). 
It can understand and generate code, making it a powerful tool for developers. 
With its ability to analyze code and suggest improvements, it can be used to automate various tasks, including fixing breaking changes in your code base.

## The Problem 
When you update a dependency, especially major version updates, it can introduce breaking changes that require manual intervention to fix.
Usually these surface as errors in your CI/CD pipeline, which can be time-consuming to debug and fix.

```yaml
on: [pull_request]
```
