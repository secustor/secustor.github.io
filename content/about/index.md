Hey, I'm Sebastian!

I am a **Platform Engineer** and **Open Source Maintainer** specializing in **Developer Experience (DevEx)**, **Kubernetes**, and **Supply Chain Security**.

Currently, I work as a Tech Lead at [N26](https://n26.com), helping teams ship faster and safer.

I also offer **consulting services** for organizations looking to improve their internal developer platforms, adopt **Renovate** at scale, or implement **OpenTelemetry**.

[👉 Check out my services and how we can work together](/hire/)

### Open Source

I am an active maintainer and contributor to several CNCF and open source projects:

- **[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate):** Core maintainer, focusing on dependency automation.
- **[OpenTelemetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry):** Contributor to the JS ecosystem.
- **[Backstage](https://backstage.io):** Plugin developer and community member.

When I'm not coding or consulting, you can find me [speaking at conferences](/talks/) or blogging about my engineering adventures.
