Hi, I'm Sebastian Poxhofer, a Lead Site Reliability Engineer at N26, a leading Fintech bank, where I focus on empowering engineering teams and ensuring the reliability and scalability of our platform. Outside of work, my hands are kept full of my wonderful wife, our energetic toddler, and our two feline overlords.

My tech journey started about 10 years ago with the rewarding chaos of homelabbing. This hands-on experience ignited a passion for building and understanding complex systems, which has fueled my career in Platform Engineering and SRE across diverse industries, including Fintech, E-Commerce, and Consulting.

I bring over a decade of experience helping organizations like yours navigate the complexities of modern cloud-native environments, streamline development workflows, and achieve operational excellence. And when I'm not immersed in the world of infrastructure and code, you'll likely find me exploring the depths of the ocean through scuba diving or contributing to the vibrant open-source community â€“ a passion that deeply aligns with my professional work.

### Scale Your Platform with Confidence: Expert SRE & Platform Engineering Consulting

**Here's how I can help your organization:**

My experience at N26 and supporting other scaling companies has equipped me with a deep understanding of the challenges involved in managing complex microservice architectures and large-scale platforms. I can provide expert guidance and implementation support in the following key areas:

- **Internal Developer Portal (IDP) Strategy & Implementation:** I have a proven track record of leading the development and adoption of Internal Developer Portals, like Backstage, to enhance developer experience, improve discoverability of services, and enforce best practices.
- **Github Governance & Automation:** I can help you establish effective governance models for your Github organization, implement automation for repository management, and ensure security and compliance.
- **Vulnerability Management & Patching:** I spearheaded the introduction of RenovateBot at N26, significantly reducing vulnerabilities and streamlining patch management processes. I can help you implement and optimize similar solutions for your organization.
- **Backstage Adoption & Customization:** As an early adopter and advocate of Backstage, I can guide you through the entire lifecycle of adopting Backstage, from initial setup and plugin selection to custom plugin development tailored to your specific needs.
- **Observability Strategy & Implementation:** I am a strong proponent of observability and can help you define and implement robust observability standards using tools like OpenTelemetry. This includes establishing best practices for logging, metrics, and tracing to gain deep insights into your system's behavior.
- **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) Best Practices:** I can help your teams adopt and implement core SRE principles and practices to improve system reliability, availability, and performance. This includes defining SLOs/SLAs, implementing error budgets, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement.

### Why Choose Me?

Beyond my extensive professional experience, I bring a unique perspective and a proven track record of success across diverse organizational structures and regulatory landscapes:

- **RenovateBot Maintainer:** As an active maintainer of RenovateBot, I possess in-depth knowledge of its capabilities and can provide expert guidance on configuration, customization, and troubleshooting. My commitment to this project stems from my belief in the power of automation for managing the ever-growing complexity of software dependencies, a crucial aspect in any environment, especially regulated ones.
- **OpenTelemetry Member:** My involvement in the OpenTelemetry community ensures I am up-to-date with the latest advancements in observability standards and best practices. Just like exploring the underwater world requires clear visibility, I believe robust observability is crucial for navigating complex systems, and even more so when compliance and auditability are paramount in regulated industries.
- **Backstage Community Member:** I am an active member of the Backstage community and have experience building custom plugins, including those for extracting dependency data via Renovate, demonstrating my commitment to extending its functionality. This adaptability is key to tailoring solutions to the specific needs of various organizations, including those with strict compliance requirements.
- **Practical Experience in Diverse Environments:** My experience spans across various industries, including fast-paced scale-ups like N26, and critically, **highly regulated environments such as German health insurance companies, government agencies, and banks.** This background has provided me with a deep understanding of the specific challenges and compliance requirements inherent in these sectors. I am adept at implementing solutions that meet stringent security, auditability, and regulatory standards.
- **Passion for Open Source:** I believe in the power of open source and actively contribute to the communities surrounding the technologies I specialize in. This collaborative spirit is fundamental to how I approach problem-solving, ensuring solutions are robust, well-supported, and adaptable to evolving needs, including those driven by regulatory changes.

This revised section now explicitly highlights your experience in regulated environments, making it a more compelling selling point for potential clients in those industries. Let me know if you have any other refinements in mind!
